            Hi, I’m ERMFox, a passionate game designer, worldbuilder, and backend developer.
            I love creating immersive experiences through storytelling, art, and interactive gameplay.

    <!-- Background and Journey -->
    <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">My Journey</h2>
        <p>
            My journey started with a fascination for the stories and worlds within my favorite games. Over time, that passion
            turned into worldbuilding, writing, and eventually game development. I’ve completed my apprenticeship in software development and am now attending BM2 (Berufsmaturität) with a focus on art & design.
            Along the way, I’ve explored backend development, storytelling, art, and game systems to build a foundation
            for the kind of immersive, meaningful games I want to create.

    <!-- Values and Motivation -->
    <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">What Drives Me</h2>
        <p>
            My goal as a creator is to bring joy, hope, and meaning through interactive experiences. Games were a big
            part of why I found hope during tough times, and I want to give back by creating worlds where players
            can find their own solace and excitement.

    <!-- Goals and Aspirations -->
    <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">My Goals</h2>
        <p>
            I’m currently building my portfolio. My next major goal is to study game design at ZHdK,
            where I can grow as both a developer and a creative thinker. Long-term, I aspire to work in the game industry as a narrative designer or concept artist,
            combining storytelling, technical skills, and worldbuilding into projects that resonate with players.
