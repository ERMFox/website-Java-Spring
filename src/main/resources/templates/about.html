        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200">
            Hi, I’m <strong>Sophie</strong> (ERMFox) — a <strong>Backend / Full-Stack Software Developer</strong>
            with a focus on building reliable services, clean APIs, and maintainable systems.
            I enjoy working on projects that involve real-world constraints like validation, automation,
            deployment workflows, and long-term maintainability.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- What I focus on -->
    <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">What I focus on</h2>
        <p>
            My main interest lies in backend engineering and full-stack development: designing REST APIs,
            structuring applications cleanly, working with databases, and ensuring that systems behave
            predictably in production-like environments.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            Many of my projects emphasize engineering practices such as validation, error handling,
            modular architecture, testing, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment strategies like blue-green or canary releases.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Background -->
    <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Background</h2>
        <p>
            I completed an apprenticeship as a software developer (EFZ) and have experience across backend development,
            web applications, and infrastructure-related topics such as containerization and deployment automation.
            Through both school and personal projects, I’ve built systems ranging from REST backends to CI pipelines
            and full web applications.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            Alongside software development, I spend a lot of time with game design and worldbuilding.
            This background strongly influences how I think about software: I naturally consider system boundaries,
            edge cases, user experience, and long-term structure when designing applications.
        </p>

    <!-- What I'm looking for -->
    <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">What I’m looking for</h2>
        <p>
            I’m currently looking for a role as a <strong>Backend Developer</strong> or <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong>
            where I can contribute to real systems, continue learning from experienced engineers,
            and gradually take on more responsibility.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            I especially value teams that care about code quality, clear communication,
            and building software that remains understandable and maintainable over time.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Personality -->
    <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">A bit more about me</h2>
        <p>
            I care deeply about building things that feel solid and thoughtfully designed — whether that’s an API,
            a deployment pipeline, or a creative system. I tend to be detail-oriented, ask a lot of “what happens if…”
            questions, and enjoy refining systems until they feel clean and coherent.
